System Design 1. Design a system that controls traffic lights with below assumptions:
A group of traffic lights has two components: main lights and pedestrian lights.
Main traffic lights has three colors: red, yellow and green.
Pedestrian lights has two colors: red and green.
Pedestrian lights' colors are reversed from main lights:
Main: red/yellow - pedestrian's: green
Main: green - pedestrian: red

There is a button for pedestrian lights, if button is pushed in advance, pedestrian's lights change colors according to the main ones, if button isn't pushed, pedestrian's lights remain red.
A typical junction has 4 group of lights.
Additional question: design the system in a way that allows cars which start from one junction after a red light don't have to stop at the next one.
